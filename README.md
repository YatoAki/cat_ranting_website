# README

This is my first ruby on rails project at App Academy Open Bootcamp.

About the project

  This is a cat renting website. The following functions are available.
  
  1. Upload a cat's details.
  2. Request to rent cats that are uploaded.
  3. Approve or deny the renting request.

Since this is a demo project, its functions and interface are only prototype.
